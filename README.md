# Phidgets-Project-2016
Phidget project utilizing Java to teach viewers about the different branches of the government. I created a small box with sides labeled "learn about the government", "judicial branch", "legislative brach", and "executive branch" respectively. This box was connected to a phidget motor which rotated the box 90 degrees, 90 degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees each time the user pressed the phidget sensor pad connected to the motor. Each time the box rotated 90 degrees the program would load and play a recorded audio file containing a random fact about the respective branch of the government the rotation landed on. I created 5 randomized facts for each branch. The box would then rotate 180 degrees on the 4th iteration as to skip past the title labeled side of the box.
